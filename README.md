## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js and npm installation on your environment and you can use appropriate EditorConfig plugin for your editor(not mandatory).

### Installation

Node is really easy to install & now include npm should be able to run command after the installation procedure.

    $node --version
    v8.10.0

    $npm --version
    6.8.0

#### Node Installation on Linux

To install node you will need to run the following command

    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get upgrade
    $sudo apt-get -y install nodejs

#### Finally update the version of npm

One last step that’s a good practice is to update npm. There’s a default version that came with the version of Node you just installed, but that version is commonly slightly behind the latest and greatest version of npm.

To get the most up-to-date npm, you can run the command:

    $ sudo npm install npm --global

#### Node installation on Windows

 1. Open the official page for Node.js downloads and download Node.js for Windows by clicking the "Windows Installer" option.
 2. Run the downloaded Node.js .msi Installer - including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install.
 3. To ensure Node.js has been installed, run node -v in your terminal - you should get something like v6.9.5.
 4. Update your version of npm with:

        $sudo npm install npm --global
