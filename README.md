# Docitt Admin Portal

## Requirements

You will need Node.js and npm installation on your environment and you can use appropriate EditorConfig plugin for your editor(not mandatory).

### Installation

After installation of Node & npm should be able to run command after the installation procedure.

    $node --version
    v8.10.0

    $npm --version
    6.8.0

#### Node Installation on Linux

To install node you will need to run the following command

    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get upgrade
    $sudo apt-get -y install nodejs

#### Finally update the version of npm

One last step that’s a good practice is to update npm. There’s a default version that came with the version of Node you just installed, but that version is commonly slightly behind the latest and greatest version of npm.

To get the most up-to-date npm, you can run the command:

    $sudo npm install npm --global
