# Docitt Admin Portal

## Requirements

You need Node.js and npm installation on your environment and you can use your appropriate Editor.

### Installation

The following command should be able to run after the installation to check current node and npm Version.
Node version should be more than- v8.0.0 &
npm should be more than- v6.1.0

    $node --version
    v8.10.0

    $npm --version
    6.8.0

#### Node Installation on Linux

To install node you will need to run the following command

    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get upgrade
    $sudo apt-get -y install nodejs

#### Finally update the version of npm

One last step that’s a good practice is to update npm. There’s a default version that came with the version of Node you just installed, but that version is commonly slightly behind the latest and greatest version of npm.

To get the most up-to-date npm, you can run the command:

    $sudo npm install npm --global
